# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
Pursuing my newly found passion of surfing, and chasing after a dream of moving to hawaii permanently, I contacted W. Avy who is an Investor, to pitch him a business idea where we open up a surf and Ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii.
It was paramount for me to secure his interest with solid data to guarantee his continued support of the venture.

## Surfs Up Results:
After thorough cleaning of data, meticulous manipulation and analysis. these were the main points of discussion between myself and W. Avy:
- June being arguably the best month of summer in the northern hemi-sphere, we saw a trend of consistent nice warm weather throughout the month. With the average temperatures around 75F (~24Centigrade), and with 3.25 Standard deviation, giving us the coolest day of 64F and the warmest day recording 85F

- December being the entry month of winter season in the northern hemi-sphere , there is a noticable inconsistency with the warther. Although the average temperature was around 71F (21.5C), the Standard deviation was around 3.75, giving us a new lowest temperature of 56F and a warmest of 83F.

- Despite the two months not being identical, the differences in recorded temperatures within 6 months are not drastically different due to the temperate nature of the islands.
 
## Analysis Results
Analyzing the two temperatures observed queries revealed some interesting points of to consider:
- The weather data pulled from the stations on Oahu Indicated that the weather was congruent with the business idea. The weather proved temperate enough for surfing and ice cream pretty much all-year round, from the beginning of summer till the beginning of winter.
- Given the time and resources, I would like to run more queries to get a solid background on more weather factors in order to gain a better understanding of the overall picture of the city and make data-driven decisions in regard to the business, three of these queries would be:
  - Queries on the rain fall perceptation levels through out the year, to identify the duration in which the location is suitable for surfing.
  - Queries on the wind data to make sure that doesn't interfere with potential customers enjoying the ocean.
  - Queries on at least two more data points to better gauge the year round weather of Oahu.
