# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
Pursuing my newly found passion of surfing, and chasing after a dream of moving to hawaii permanently, I contacted W. Avy who is an Investor, to pitch him a business idea where we open up a surf and Ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii.
It was paramount for me to secure his interest with solid data to guarantee his continued support of the venture.

## Surfs Up Results:
After thorough cleaning of data, meticulous manipulation and analysis. these were the main points of discussion between myself and W. Avy:
- There are approximately 70,000 senior employees across all departments that are entering the retirement phase in the near future.
- The most retiting title is Senior Engineer, with around 25,916 entering the retirement phase, While management seems to be the area least senisitive to the upcoming changes with only 2 managers matching the retirement criteria.

- The mentorship program that management proposed, seems to somewhat alleviate the problem but in no means a root solution to depend on.
- A decent pool of Engineers ,Senior Engineers, and Senior Staff looks to be viable candidates for mentorship to temporarily keep operations going.

## Analysis Summary
This analysis was carried out with mainly two questions in mind:
- ***'How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?'***
  - the ideal answer to that question is to replace exactly as much employees as the ones that are leaving, that's around 70000 across the entire company. However, if the company is planning on enhancing and updating its management chain structure to the latest standards, it would require around 2/3 of the total amount. Human Resources would be more qualified to give the definitive answer on that matter.

- ***'Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?'***
  - Based on the outcome of that task, the short answer is yes; Altough, they might be spread too thin to cover as much eligible candidates as possible. This was determinded to be an effective temporary measure, but an ineffective long term solution.
